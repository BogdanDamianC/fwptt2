                            Solved a bug that was keeping the running test thread alive indefinitely
                            now the testing also works on another ports than 80.
                            Added functionality in results viewer for exporting the data through custom xsl templates.

                            Added new form for viewing/modifying existing the recorded requests and their params.

                            This version is a bug solver: Changing the default port or IP proxy address made recording to start working. There were some problems when running multiple threads and when the running test was stopped.

                            This version has some bugs solved which were anoying and also contains a waiting time added in order to avoid request blocking by the web servers.
                            Tested on IIS but probably the other web servers have a similar protection too. Also I've added the port in the recorded data in order to be able to test on servers that use other port than the regular one(80).

                            This version solves a problem that the proxy had with the communication on http1.1. The behaviour was that it didn't recorded all the requests.
                            I've also added a compilation window so that you can have a better view of what is going on there.
                            There were also some other small bugs solved.

                            The application was moved to 2.0 Net framework. The recording functionality was changed now I'm using a proxy. So now also the ajax requests are recorded by the system. Also I've added a sources repository.

                            This is the first application verison the software is full functionabile(aside the bugs not found yet). You can record your page navigation made in IE, save the data in an XML format or generate a C# class directly. Also you can execute the XML or the class. After I make some order with the sources I will also put the sources here.
