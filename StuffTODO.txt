[Finish the Test Run Definition Desktop Implementation]

[In Progress] Make the test running even more generic so that it go further than http calls
update the test definition references to use something similar to how the typescript references are done
update the plugin updates to use an event driven approach in order to avoid unnecessary calls similar to the one used in the timeline plugins

[DONE] [Move the Test Definition Generator outside the main desktop project]
