[Finish the Test Run Definition Desktop Implementation]
Implement the Test Run (based on the Test Run Definition)
MiliSecondsPauseBetweenRequests must be moved into a separate plugin
Make the http based load test work - preliminary implementation
Move the Test Definition Generator outside the main desktop project
Make the test running even more generic so that it go further than http calls
